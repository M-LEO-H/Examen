        <h2>Datatorget</h2>
        <p>Datatorget is an area dedicated to IT students, and is a popular place to work.
            The square has several group rooms where you can work, and they are often completely full.
            But if you don't get a seat here, there are many tables scattered around the square where you can often find a seat.
            On the computer square you will also find a student group called oracle, which are students who work to help other students with tasks and problems.
            This is a good offer, and is often used if you are stuck.

        <h2>Canteen</h2>
            <p>The canteen is the school's meeting place and food centre. Around lunchtime, it fills up with students and teachers who are hungry for some good food.
                The canteen also offers microwave ovens and kettles that you can use.
            </p>

             <p>
                The canteen focuses on keeping it as student-friendly as possible, and thus has reasonable prices and a wide selection.
                 Everyone will find something they like here, and you will never leave here hungry! The salad bar is one of the popular options here,
                  and you often see fellow students leaving the canteen with a box filled to the brim. In addition to food, the canteen also has a wide selection of beverages,
                   including an energy drink, which is often bought on long days.
