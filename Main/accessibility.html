        <h2>Pages & pictures</h2>

        <p>We started testing our website using lighthouse in chrome. 
            The first test was the home page which had some minor problems which resulted in us getting a score of 75 in performance and 100 in the others. 
            As you can see from the picture below. </p>
        <img class="img" src="media/accessibility/fÃ¸rsteLighthouseSjekk.webp" alt="First test">
        <p>
        We fixed majority of these issues by setting a specific width and hight on the pictures keeping the aspect ratio intact. 
        This was also an issue with pictures on the website. We also worked on compressing the images as much as possible, 
        with every picture being in the webp format. The tests afterwards reflect our changes giving us scores in high 90s to 100.

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>For the code, we focused on using relative sizes that would adapt to the view port of the screen, creating a more accessible webpage. T</p>
